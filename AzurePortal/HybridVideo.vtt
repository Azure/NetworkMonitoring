00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.969
A few months ago, we changed
our public documentation to

1
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.609
organize the Azure networking
services and features

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.599
into four pillars.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.169
I'm here to talk to you
about the hybrid connectivity

4
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.859
pillar, which is also
reflected in the Azure portal.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589
When I say hybrid
connectivity, I mean getting

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.068
from the physical world,
on-prem or from a device like

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.599
a cell phone or a laptop,
into resources in Azure.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.179
First, let's look at
the Azure VPN service.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.289
VPN gateway is a collection
of objects in Azure working

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.849
together to enable an IPsec
or TLS tunnel to Azure

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.919
across the Internet.

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.989
This is done in one of two
ways, with site-to-site

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.409
tunnels starting at your
on-premise location with

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.569
a physical device like a
router or firewall, or a

15
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.749
point-to-site connection
from your mobile device

16
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.629
like a cell phone, tablet,
laptop, or other supported

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.959
Internet connected devices.

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.929
For both point-to-site and
site-to-site, you start

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.019
with a VPN gateway connected
to your Azure VNet.

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.819
With point-to-site, a client
application or client config,

21
00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.919
is installed on the device
and is connected securely

22
00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.959
to the VPN gateway.

23
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.338
For a site-to-site connection,
a local network gateway object

24
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.299
is created that represents
the IP address of the on-prem

25
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.519
device and then a connection
object is created to join

26
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429
the local network gateway
to the VPN gateway.

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.209
This establishes the secure
tunnel through the Internet.

28
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.149
Next, we look at the
ExpressRoute service.

29
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.088
Like VPN, ExpressRoute is
about getting connectivity

30
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.529
from your premise
to Microsoft, but in

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.849
ExpressRoute's case,
doing this by not

32
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.659
using the internet.

33
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.368
Most customers work with
a service provider like

34
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.948
AT &T or any of our over
200 ExpressRoute partners

35
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.669
to provide a private,
non-internet path to

36
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.499
Microsoft's network.

37
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.109
Once connected with an
ExpressRoute circuit, you

38
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.519
can go to Microsoft public
and Azure public services

39
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.219
like SQL Server, Azure
Storage, Dynamics, or

40
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.769
in some cases, M365.

41
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.879
This is done using public
IP addresses over Microsoft

42
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.649
Peering, the orange
lines in this diagram.

43
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.558
In this scenario, you would
also use a route filter

44
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.759
feature to reduce the BGP
overhead to only receive

45
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.279
the specific address
ranges for the regions

46
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.429
or services you need.

47
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.349
However, most commonly
used is private peering.

48
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.479
This is the blue box
in the lower right-hand

49
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.349
corner of the diagram.

50
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.839
Using an ExpressRoute gateway
on the VNet and a connection

51
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.259
object between the circuit
and the gateway allows you

52
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.039
to extend your corporate
on-premise private network

53
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.659
into Azure and access your
Azure resources directly

54
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.289
on this private data path.

55
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.389
Again, not using the Internet.

56
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.439
ExpressRoute enables you to
connect multiple ExpressRoute

57
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.969
gateways in the same or
different regions back

58
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.739
to the same circuit.

59
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.249
For our largest premium
ExpressRoute circuit,

60
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.189
that could be up to 100
ExpressRoute gateways in any

61
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.279
region in the world back to
the same ExpressRoute circuit.

62
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.849
There's also an ExpressRoute
direct port option, which

63
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.259
would replace the partner
edge in the diagram.

64
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.409
This allows you to connect
your edge router directly to

65
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.229
the Microsoft routers in a
facility for direct connection

66
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.599
to the Microsoft network.

67
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.429
Also, for monitoring, we
offer the ExpressRoute

68
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.279
Traffic Collector.

69
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.169
This feature can provide
detailed flow data on your

70
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.549
circuits to be able to
identify things like top

71
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.639
talkers or other traffic-based
metrics and queries.

72
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.809
The final service I'll
cover in the hybrid

73
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.639
connectivity pillar is
our virtual WAN service.

74
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.419
As the diagram shows, Virtual
WAN, also called vWAN, brings

75
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.979
together all of the features
of ExpressRoute and VPN,

76
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.539
and then extends them for
any-to-any connectivity

77
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.789
into and across Azure.

78
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.879
If you're familiar with a
hub-and-spoke architecture,

79
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.999
a Virtual WAN implements this
in a concise, single-object

80
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.499
structure to implement the
hub-and-spoke scaffolding

81
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.629
much faster than you
could build yourself.

82
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.569
If you use a vWAN-aware
SDN hardware device on

83
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.579
your premise, you get
large-scale VPN automation.

84
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.489
Just log into your on-prem
device with your Azure

85
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.589
credentials, and it can
auto-configure the device and

86
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.819
establish the IPsec connection
back to your vWAN hub.

87
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.629
This is great if you
have many branch offices

88
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.929
or retail outlets that
need VPN connections to

89
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.939
your Azure workloads.

90
00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.069
vWAN also integrates with
Azure Firewall, but not just

91
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.689
Azure's firewall, but also
to other popular firewalls

92
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.449
from the marketplace to turn
your regular vWAN hub into

93
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.299
what we call a secure hub.

94
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.409
This allows you to use the
firewall of your choice and

95
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.459
your unique security policies
to make your WAN secure.

96
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.749
vWAN introduces many other
routing features like route

97
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.849
maps, routing intent, and
others to manage the flows

98
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.339
across the virtual WAN.

99
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.009
All of this together allows
you to enable, secure, and

100
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.489
control your network traffic,
making the Microsoft backbone

101
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.859
and Azure your corporate WAN.

102
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.169
Hopefully this provides
some insight into the

103
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.349
three main services in our
hybrid connectivity pillar,

104
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.379
Azure VPN, ExpressRoute,
and Virtual WAN.
